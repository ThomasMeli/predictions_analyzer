# predictions_analyzer

Predictions Analyzer is a powerful Auto-ML tool to help discover which models perform best on the kinds of samples you have.  It also has integrations with Optuna and Weights And Biases that allow you to monitor results and hyperoptimize your models.  

This allows you to create local models and ensemble models with precision, while also finding out which samples are the most challenging to classify.
